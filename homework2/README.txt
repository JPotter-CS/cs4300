--------------- AI USE ---------------
--------------------------------------------------------
Perplexity AI was used throughout this assignment. Perplexity can use an array of different models so I do not know exactly which AI
model was used to assist me in the assignment. Perplexity was used to assist me when I would run into errors when running locally and running
on render. Code was generated by AI but it was not copy and pasted. It was used as a reference for my own code development. The files AI
assisted me with were my HTML template files, settings.py, and 

P.S. Perplexity is awful at figuring out 502 errors
