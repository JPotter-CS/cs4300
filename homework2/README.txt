--------------- AI USE ---------------
--------------------------------------------------------
Perplexity AI was used throughout this assignment. Perplexity can use an array of different models so I do not know exactly which AI
model was used to assist me in the assignment. Perplexity was used to assist me when I would run into errors when running locally and running
on render. Code was generated by AI but it was NOT copy and pasted. It was used as a reference for my own code development. The files AI
assisted me with were my HTML template files and settings.py.

P.S. Perplexity is awful at assisting with 502 errors. Figured out the issue was me not running it on the right port within DevEdu.
Port 8000 was not working and had to switch to port 3000
